The barriers include:\n* **Complexity:** Uncertainty about which department to contact (e.g., Parks vs. Transportation).\n* **Time:** Lack of time to draft formal correspondence.\n* **Intimidation:** Difficulty writing in the formal tone required by city officials.\n\n### The Solution\nThe **Civic-Helper** is an intelligent, multi-agent system that acts as a bridge between citizens and their local government. It simplifies the reporting process into a friendly chat.\n\nThe system uses a \"Front-End\" agent to interview the user and gather details, and a specialized \"Back-End\" agent running on a separate server to draft the letter and **automatically dispatch it** using a simulated SMTP email tool via the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**.\n\n### Technical Architecture\nThis project demonstrates advanced Agentic AI concepts by utilizing a **Multi-Agent System**.\n\n**1. Agent 1: The \"Community Advocate\" (Front-End)**\n* **Role:** Acts as the user interface. It is empathetic, patient, and encouraging.\n* **Key Skill - Memory:** Uses `InMemorySessionService` to maintain context across multiple turns of conversation.\n* **Key Skill - Constraints:** Strictly programmed to interview the user first before attempting to solve the problem.\n* **Key Skill - Tool Use:** Accesses the remote backend agent via `RemoteA2aAgent`.\n\n**2. Agent 2: The \"Formal Drafter\" (Back-End)**\n* **Role:** A specialized expert running as an independent server service.\n* **Key Skill - Server Deployment:** Deployed using `uvicorn` and wrapped with `to_a2a` to simulate a production microservice.\n* **Key Skill - Expert Prompting:** Tuned strictly for formal business writing, formatting, and tone.\n* **Key Skill - Automated Action:** Uses a custom Python tool (`send_email_to_city`) to identify the correct department and simulate an SMTP email dispatch.\n\n### How It Works\n1.  **Interview:** The user initiates a chat. The Advocate Agent greets them and uses memory to track the specific issue (e.g., \"broken swing set\") and location.\n2.  **Delegation:** Once the Advocate Agent has sufficient details, it triggers an A2A call to the Drafter Agent on the local server.\n3.  **Action:** The Drafter Agent writes the formal letter and **executes the email tool**, routing the complaint to the correct department (e.g., `parks_dept@city.gov.public`).\n4.  **Confirmation:** The Advocate Agent receives the success log (Confirmation ID) via A2A and presents it to the user, confirming their voice has been heard.\n\n### Proof of Quality (Evaluation)\nThe system was validated using a custom **LLM-as-a-Judge** evaluation suite written in Python. The evaluation script runs automated test cases against the agent and scores the output based on three dimensions:\n* **Format:** Detection of standard business letter conventions.\n* **Tone:** Verification of polite and authoritative language.\n* **Content:** Confirmation that specific user details were correctly included.\n\n**Result:** The system achieved perfect scores on valid inputs, demonstrating robust tool usage and context retention.\n\n### Future Roadmap\n* **Live SMTP Integration:** Switch the existing \"Simulated Dispatch\" tool to a live SendGrid or Gmail API connection for real-world production.\n* **Language Support:** Adding multilingual capabilities to help non-English speaking citizens.\n* **Voice Interface:** Adding a voice-to-text layer so seniors can speak their complaints instead of typing.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Setup and Authentication\nMounts the necessary API keys to allow the agent to communicate with the Gemini model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\n\ntry:\n    GOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n    os.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = GOOGLE_API_KEY\n    print(\"Setup and authentication complete.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Authentication Error: Please make-sure you've added GOOGLE_API_KEY to your Kaggle secrets.
